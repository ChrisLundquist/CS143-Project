This project requires Jogl with its native extensions for Graphics and JLayer
for sound. 
JOGL is not packaged with this project due to its size and native extension
naming conflicts:
JOGL can be found at:
http://www.jogamp.org/

JLayer is included in lib/ and can be found at:
http://www.javazoom.net/javalayer/javalayer.html


Installing Java OpenGL
1. Download the latest build of JoGL for your architecture from
    http://jogamp.org/deployment/autobuilds/master/
2. Extract the zip file to a sensable location, I recommend
    C:\lib\jogl-2.0 or ~/lib/jogl-2.0.
3. In Eclipse add JoGL as a user library:
    i.    Window->Preferences (Eclipse->Preferences on MacOS)
    ii.   Java->Build Path->User Libraries
    iii.  New, name the library "jogl-2.0", click OK
    iv.   Click Add JARs
    v.    Navigate to the location you chose in step 2,
          then jar, choose 'jogl.all.jar'
    vi.   Select Native library location for 'jogl.all.jar'
    vii.  Click Edit, External Folder
    viii. Navigate to the location you chose in step 2,
          then lib, click OK
    ix.   Repeat steps iii through viii for 'gluegen-rt.jar',
          'nativewindow.all.jar', and 'newt.all.jar'
    x.    Click OK to close the preferences panel
